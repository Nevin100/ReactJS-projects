# ⚛️ ReactJS-Projects – The Beginner Buffet 🍱

Welcome to **ReactJs- Projects** – a hand-crafted collection of **basic React.js projects** that helped me turn from a confused beginner into a component-slinging developer. 🚀

This repo is like my **React dojo**, where I battled `useState`, befriended `props`, and tamed the wild `useEffect`. Every mini project here played a role in building my muscle memory for React fundamentals.

> 🗓️ Built ~10 months ago — but still packs a punch of learning!

## 🧰 What's Inside?

A bunch of **bite-sized** React projects — no frameworks, no fancy tools, just **pure React + Tailwind (sometimes)** and 💯 effort.

### 📦 Projects Included

- ✅ **To-Do App** – My first ever state management trial
- ⏱️ **Counter & Timer** – Time-based state changes like a pro
and many more..
Each one small, self-contained, and focused on 1-2 key concepts.

## 🔍 Why This Repo Exists

This was **my sandbox** — a place to get hands-on with core React concepts:

- `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, `useReducer`
- Prop drilling vs lifting state
- Handling form inputs
- Component architecture
- Conditional rendering
- Basic routing

If you're starting out or revising, these are **go-to drills**.
